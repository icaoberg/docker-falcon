FALCON for Python over Docker. halcon is a python implementation of the Feedback Adaptive Loop for Content-Based Retrieval (FALCON) algorithm as described in

* Leejay Wu, Christos Faloutsos, Katia P. Sycara, and Terry R. Payne. 2000. [FALCON: Feedback Adaptive Loop for Content-Based Retrieval](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~christos/PUBLICATIONS/vldb2k-falcon.pdf). In Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB '00), Amr El Abbadi, Michael L. Brodie, Sharma Chakravarthy, Umeshwar Dayal, Nabil Kamel, Gunter Schlageter, and Kyu-Young Whang (Eds.). Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA, 297-306.

FALCON is, as described in the article abstract, "a novel method that is designed to handle disjunctive queries within metric spaces. The user provides weights for positive examples; our system 'learns' the implied concept and returns similar objects."
